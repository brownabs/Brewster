# Welcome to Brewster üçª

As a home brewer, I would often lose track of my notes from previous recipes, brewing days, fermentation times, bottle dates, and when my beer was finally ready to drink. I was able to combine my love for home brewing with my knowledge of React, Moment.js and CSS for styling. Brewster contains fully implemented CRUD for recipes and batches, and a boil timer for brewing day.

****Main functionality:****

1. Create beer recipes
2. View recipe details
3. Edit and Delete recipes
4. Brew Day Page displays the selected recipe, a boil timer, 
    and allows the user to create time specific comments associated with the batch (completed recipe)
5. Edit Batch Fermentation Times
6. Delete Batches
7. Complete Batches

****DETAILS****

Brewster is a front-end application built with React, Moment.js, and CSS. All data is user-generated and stored in a json-server database.


****TO CLONE****

Clone the repo to your computer and run npm install in the directory

Start the json-server:

cd into api folder
run json-server -p 3003 -w database.json
When you're ready to start the server:

make sure you are in the ReactNutshell directory
run npm start
This will run the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. Data will be served from the main API hosted online.

Upon Registration, Brewster will display a Getting Start page that includes a quick video recording of how to use the application.
