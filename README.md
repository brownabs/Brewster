# Welcome to Brewster üçª

## As a home brewer, I would often lose track of my notes from previous recipes, brewing days, fermentation times, bottle dates, and when my beer was finally ready to drink. I was able to combine my love for home brewing with my knowledge of React, Moment.js and CSS for styling. Brewster contains fully implemented CRUD for recipes and batches, and a boil timer for brewing day.

#Main functionality:

## 1. Create beer recipes
## 2. View recipe details
## 3. Edit and Delete recipes
## 4. Brew Day Page that displays the selected recipe, a boil timer, 
##    and allows the user to create time specific comments associated with the         batch
